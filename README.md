# Optimisation Method Comparison using Generated "Creatures"

This piece of software is made to randomly generate a specified number of creatures, then evolve them using various optimisation methods until a maximum is reached. It is meant to be a way of seeing how successful the three optimisation methods are in terms of speed and reaching a local/global maximum.
